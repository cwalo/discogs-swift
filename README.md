## DiscogsSwift

# What is this?
These are simply Swift models used to decode responses from the Discogs API.

# Why?
If you want to build a Swift client that integrates with Discogs, I've done a lot of the leg work.

# What's missing?
* I haven't added any models related to managing user collections and wantlists, because I haven't needed to, but feel free to add them and submit a PR.
* There's no client to actually make requests, so roll your own with URLSession :)
